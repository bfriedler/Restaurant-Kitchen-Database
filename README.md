# Restaurant-Kitchen-Database
This database keeps track of the food supply in a restaurant kitchen. The Item_Info table stores information about each item the kitchen keeps track of. The Item_Exp table keeps track of the current supply of each item. Stored procedures can be used to get the total quantity in stock of a specific item, get a list of all item expiring within the coming week, and get the next upcoming delivery date for a specific item.
